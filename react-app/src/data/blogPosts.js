      <p>Product discovery is the foundation of successful product development, yet many teams struggle with where to start. This comprehensive framework breaks down discovery into actionable layers that help product managers validate ideas before building.</p>

      <h2>The Product Discovery Challenge</h2>
      <p>Too many product teams jump straight into building features without properly understanding their users' needs. This leads to wasted resources, frustrated customers, and products that miss the mark.</p>

      <h2>The Discovery Pyramid Framework</h2>
      <p>The Product Discovery Pyramid provides a structured approach to validation:</p>

      <h3>Level 1: Problem Validation</h3>
      <p>Before building any solution, validate that the problem you're solving actually exists and matters to your target users.</p>

      <h3>Level 2: Solution Validation</h3>
      <p>Once you've confirmed the problem, test potential solutions with low-fidelity prototypes and user interviews.</p>

      <h3>Level 3: Implementation Validation</h3>
      <p>Finally, validate your specific implementation approach through usability testing and technical feasibility studies.</p>

      <h2>Making It Work</h2>
      <p>The key to successful product discovery is spending adequate time at each level before moving to the next. Most teams rush through problem validation and pay the price later.</p>

      <p>Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) have become ubiquitous in product management, but most teams implement them poorly. Here's how to create OKRs that actually drive meaningful product outcomes and team alignment.</p>

      <h2>The OKR Problem</h2>
      <p>Most product teams treat OKRs as a reporting exercise rather than a strategic planning tool. They create vague objectives and measure vanity metrics instead of outcomes that matter.</p>

      <h2>Building Better OKRs</h2>
      <p>Effective product OKRs should be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Outcome-focused:</strong> Measure user and business impact, not feature delivery</li>
        <li><strong>Specific and measurable:</strong> Clear success criteria that everyone understands</li>
        <li><strong>Ambitious but achievable:</strong> Stretch the team without setting them up for failure</li>
        <li><strong>Aligned with strategy:</strong> Connect directly to your product and company vision</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
      <p>Don't use OKRs to track everything you're doing. Focus on the 3-5 most important outcomes that will move your product forward.</p>

      <h2>Making OKRs Stick</h2>
      <p>The magic happens in regular check-ins and adjustments. OKRs aren't set-and-forget documents—they're living tools for product strategy.</p>

      <p>"Data-driven" has become a product management mantra, but blindly following data can lead teams astray. Learn when to trust the numbers, when to question them, and how to balance quantitative insights with qualitative understanding.</p>

      <h2>The Data-Driven Fallacy</h2>
      <p>Being data-driven doesn't mean making every decision based on spreadsheets. It means using data as one input in a broader decision-making framework that includes user empathy, market context, and strategic vision.</p>

      <h2>When Data Misleads</h2>
      <p>Data can be misleading when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sample sizes are too small to be meaningful</li>
        <li>You're measuring the wrong metrics</li>
        <li>External factors skew the results</li>
        <li>You're looking at correlation, not causation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Role of Intuition</h2>
      <p>Great product managers combine data insights with intuition built through deep user understanding. Sometimes the data tells you what happened, but intuition helps you understand why.</p>

      <h2>Building a Balanced Approach</h2>
      <p>The best product decisions come from triangulating multiple sources: quantitative data, qualitative insights, market research, and strategic context. Use data to inform, not replace, good judgment.</p>

    title: 'Why "Follow Your Passion" is BS',
    author: 'Brett Flügel',

    excerpt: 'The "follow your passion" advice assumes we all have a pre-existing passion, which is simply not true for most people. This flawed assumption puts unnecessary pressure on careers and ignores the reality that passion often develops through mastery...',
    content: `
      <p>If you perused my list of top hates, "follow your passion" would be close to the top.</p>

      <p>This advice always seems to emanate from trust-fund-mom-and-dad-pay-my-rent types. But that's not the reason it pisses me off. It's simply useless advice.</p>

      <p>"Follow your passion" has the immediate assumption that we all have a passion to begin with, which in most cases is simply not true. Think of how many people you know who would love to be a firefighter, a doctor or a teacher? Perhaps it's only a handful of people you know? It's flawed to assume that we all have a passion before we have truly engaged in any one career path.</p>

      <p>What does "passion" even mean in a work setting? Is it not enough to simply like what we do because it is challenging and engaging? Having to be passionate in our careers puts this superfluous pressure on us when things are not all dandy, such is life, be grateful for what you have and make the most of it.</p>

      <p>"Follow your passion" also presupposes that if you really like something and you match that to your job you will have a long-term, engaging and satisfying career. This has proven again and again not to be true, look at all the passionate amateur photographers, bakers and writers who end up miserable doing what they love.</p>

      <p>Maybe it's not how you get started that matters but what you do once you get going. In other words, you should end up being passionate about what you do, you shouldn't always do something because you are passionate about it. Get good at something and in doing so become passionate about it.</p>

      <p>When you are really good at something you can pick and choose the projects that you want to work on, isn't that what we really want? The choice not to have to do the mundane parts of the job? You can't expect a really good working life, unless you are really good at what you do.</p>

      <p>So let's stop telling everyone to "follow your passion" and get to work!</p>
