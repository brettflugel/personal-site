          <p>"We need to be more data-driven." It's become the rallying cry of product teams everywhere. But in our rush to embrace data, we've created a dangerous myth: that good product decisions come from simply following the numbers.</p>

          <p>Don't misunderstand me—data is crucial for product success. But the idea that data should drive all product decisions has led teams down costly rabbit holes and missed opportunities. The most successful product teams aren't data-driven; they're data-informed.</p>

          <h2>When Data Leads You Astray</h2>
          <p>Here are real scenarios where blind faith in data can backfire:</p>

          <h3>The Vanity Metrics Trap</h3>
          <p>A team I worked with was obsessed with increasing page views. Every feature decision was evaluated based on whether it would drive more traffic. They succeeded—page views increased 40%. But user satisfaction plummeted, churn spiked, and revenue dropped. They were optimizing for the wrong metric entirely.</p>

          <h3>The Short-Term Optimization Problem</h3>
          <p>A/B tests typically run for days or weeks, but their impact can take months to fully understand. A feature that tests well initially might create user fatigue over time. Conversely, features that initially test poorly often show positive long-term effects as users adapt.</p>

          <h3>The Context Blindness Issue</h3>
          <p>Data tells you what happened, but rarely why. A 20% drop in feature usage might look alarming in analytics, but qualitative research might reveal that users found a better way to accomplish the same task—actually a sign of product evolution, not failure.</p>

          <h2>The Limits of Data</h2>
          <p>Understanding data's limitations is crucial for making better product decisions:</p>

          <h3>1. Data Is Historical</h3>
          <p>Analytics show you what users did yesterday, not what they'll want tomorrow. Revolutionary products often succeed despite initial data suggesting otherwise. Netflix's shift to streaming showed poor early metrics but transformed the industry.</p>

          <h3>2. Users Don't Always Know What They Want</h3>
          <p>Henry Ford's famous quote applies here: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." User behavior data can't capture needs users haven't articulated yet.</p>

          <h3>3. Correlation vs. Causation</h3>
          <p>The classic mistake: seeing two metrics move together and assuming one caused the other. Sophisticated analytics can help, but human judgment is often needed to separate signal from noise.</p>

          <h2>Building a Data-Informed Culture</h2>
          <p>Instead of being data-driven, successful product teams are data-informed. Here's how to build this culture:</p>

          <h3>Start with Hypotheses</h3>
          <p>Before looking at data, form clear hypotheses about what you expect to see and why. This prevents you from cherry-picking metrics that support predetermined conclusions.</p>

          <h3>Combine Quantitative and Qualitative</h3>
          <p>Numbers tell you what; qualitative research tells you why. The most powerful insights come from combining both:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Analytics show a drop in feature usage</li>
            <li>User interviews reveal why users stopped using it</li>
            <li>The combination guides your product decision</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Question Your Metrics</h3>
          <p>Regularly audit your key metrics. Ask:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Do these metrics actually predict business success?</li>
            <li>Are we measuring outcomes or just outputs?</li>
            <li>What incentives do these metrics create?</li>
            <li>What important aspects are we not measuring?</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>A Framework for Data-Informed Decisions</h2>
          <p>Here's a practical framework I use with product teams:</p>

          <h3>1. Define the Decision Context</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>What decision are we making?</li>
            <li>What are the potential options?</li>
            <li>What are the stakes and timeline?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Identify Relevant Data Sources</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Quantitative: Analytics, A/B tests, surveys</li>
            <li>Qualitative: User interviews, support feedback, market research</li>
            <li>Internal: Technical constraints, business goals, team capacity</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Gather and Analyze</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Look for convergent evidence across multiple sources</li>
            <li>Identify gaps or contradictions in the data</li>
            <li>Consider what data might be missing</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>4. Apply Judgment</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>What does your product intuition say?</li>
            <li>How does this align with broader strategy?</li>
            <li>What are the long-term implications?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>5. Decide and Monitor</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Make the decision based on all available information</li>
            <li>Define success metrics and timeline</li>
            <li>Plan how you'll measure and iterate</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>Data is a powerful tool, but it's just that—a tool. The best product managers I know use data to inform their decisions, not make them. They combine analytical rigor with product intuition, user empathy, and strategic thinking.</p>

          <p>Stop trying to be data-driven. Start being data-informed. Your products—and your users—will thank you.</p>
